This repository contains implementations of the paper [Rapidly Mixing Multiple-try Metropolis Algorithms for Model Selection Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00689) by Hyunwoong Chang, Changwoo Lee, Zhao Tang Luo, Huiyan Sang, and Quan Zhou, which is accepted at [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022). 

We study multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) algorithm, which is an extension of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm by selecting the proposed state among multiple trials according to some weight function $w(y\,|\,x)$.

We show that multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) algorithm can achieve a mixing time bound smaller than that of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm by a factor of the number of trials under a general setting applicable to high-dimensional model selection problems.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rapidMTM like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
