This repository contains implementations of the paper [Rapidly Mixing Multiple-try Metropolis Algorithms for Model Selection Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00689) by Hyunwoong Chang, Changwoo Lee, Zhao Tang Luo, Huiyan Sang, and Quan Zhou, which is accepted at [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022). 

We study multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) algorithm [(Liu, Liang, and Wong, 2000)](#references), which is an extension of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm by selecting the proposed state among multiple trials according to some weight function $w(y|x)$. Below cartoon depicts how MTM algorithms choose the proposed state $y=y_2$ among $N=3$ trials ($y_1,y_2,y_3$) from the current state $x_t$.

We prove that MTM algorithm can achieve a mixing time bound smaller than that of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm *by a factor of the number of trials $N$* under a general setting applicable to high-dimensional model selection problems, such as Bayesian variable selection, stochastic block models, and spatial clustering models.

## Example 1: Bayesian variable selection

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example1}
## basic example code
```


## Example 2: Stochastic block models

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example2}
## basic example code
```
